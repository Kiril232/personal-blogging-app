This application was developed as part of the "Fundamentals of Web Design" course at the FCSE. It serves as a practical demonstration of my web development skills at the time. It is created using React and Firebase, and other modules such as react router for routing, quill as an editor, etc.

To run the project you can download the folder and run 'serve build' in the root directory.
